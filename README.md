### Summary

I do not believe there is positivty bias for reviews in the Vine program. Majority of the reviews are from verified customers not engaged in the Amazon Vine Program. Filter through the data concluded that 99% of the reviews are from non-Vine which helps me conclude that they are verified customers.
To help support my statement, we can narrow the filter throught the dataframe as I demonstarted earlier and prove that the verified consumers are the voice of the products.
